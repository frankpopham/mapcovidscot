# mapcovidscot

This is an attempt to map by local neighbourhoods the development of covid cases in Scotland's 32 local authorities (councils).
Data are open data from NHS Scotland https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-in-scotland/resource/8906de12-f413-4b3f-95a0-11ed15e61773 .

Rates are per 100,000. For confidentiality if there are fewer than 3 cases no rate is given see https://publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/covid-19/covid-19-data-and-intelligence/covid-19-daily-cases-in-scotland-dashboard/how-we-publish-small-area-covid-figures/ .

This is the 7 day average. 

Neighbourhoods are scaled to their 2011 total population to reduce larger (more rural) geographies dominating the eye.
